# Temple Trekking Bog Plugin for RuneLite
This plugin helps solve the bog encounter in Temple Trekking by highlighting the tiles that you can walk on. No branches are needed which makes this encounter incredibly fast. 

## Swampletics
This idea came from a Swampletics video in which he used the RuneLite developer mode to find IDs of the bog tiles. I decided this would be good practice for me to try and make a RuneLite plugin that highlighted these tiles.

## Installation
* Clone the RuneLite repo found [here](https://github.com/runelite/runelite).
* Download this repo by clicking [here](https://github.com/i-yam-jeremy/bog-runelite-plugin/archive/master.zip)
* Unzip the repo
* Copy the `bog-runelite-plugin` folder to `RUNELITE_REPO_DIR/runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins` where `RUNELITE_REPO_DIR` is replaced with the path to the directory of where you cloned the RuneLite repo
* Open a terminal and `cd` to `RUNELITE_REPO_DIR/runelite-client`
* Run `mvn install`
* Open `RUNELITE_REPO_DIR/runelite-client/target`
* Double-click the file that starts with `client-XXXX-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar` where `XXXX` is some version number.

## Disclaimer
This plugin is made for educational purposes only, I only used it once to test it. I will not be using it in the future because it completely eliminates the need to do the bog encounter how it was supposed to be played.
